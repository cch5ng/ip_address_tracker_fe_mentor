## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS framework
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - Mapbox GL JS (vector map library)
- [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) - IP address API

### What I learned

- Using Next.js (environment variables, static file references, project structure with regards to index.html template, project structure with regards to React).

- Using Mapbox library (integrating with React, adding custom markers).

- Tailwind (although I have used it in a previous project, becoming more fluent with using it for typography, styling, layout, and responsive design).

- Using the Ipify API (REST).

### Continued development

In the future I could still learn about some of the caveats of different Next.js rendering options (server-side vs static).

### Useful resources

- [Sample React project using Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-react-examples/blob/master/basic/src/Map.js) - This helped me troubleshoot an issue with trying to add a marker to a map. Just using the Mapbox documentation for react projects did not work for me.
- [Info on Next.js static image files for CSS backgrounds](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51842419/next-js-background-image-css-property-cant-load-the-image) - This helped me troubleshoot how to reference a static image from a CSS file. Also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51842419/next-js-background-image-css-property-cant-load-the-image
- [Swagger docs on API responses](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/describing-responses/) - This helped me form the client logic for API response error handling. The Ipify API documentation didn't provide many details about errors so I had to assume they were following Open API standards.
